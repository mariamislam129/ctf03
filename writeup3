 first i opened the link and all i saw was an input bar and a submit button , we already know that the webmaster do not filter all the inputs so let's try to insert a javascript code let's say <script>alert(1);</script> 
it showed the alert(1) only and script changed to forbidden so i tried any other event let's say <img src="ldk" onload=alert(1)> but nothing happend so i tried <img src="ldk" onclick=alert(1)> but nothing happened again , then i tried <img src="ldk" onerror=alert(1)> and it did show thhe flag which is "ciyypjz" .

as we can see here is TopNewsJournal Website and it has some other taps such as about and help so we can check them , i checked them but i didn't find any sus info in it so let' check the source code of the home page and now you can trace the code but you won't find anything strange but  i noticed that there is a line says <script src="admin/assets/app.js"></script> so i thought that it can make me take privilege for admin login so i clicked on it and ot showed the query but we can view the admin login by removing assets/app.js 
now we can see username and password textboxes but let's view the source code first , as you can see there is an important line says  <input type="hidden" name="db" value="secret-database/db.json" /> so let's try to take secret-database/db.json value and put it in the link , here we are!! the flag is encrypted {"flag":"ab003765f3424bf8e2c8d1d69762d72c"} so all we have to do is decode it and it will be "badboy" .
